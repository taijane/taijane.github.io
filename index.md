My name is Tjan Meinecke, I'm 24 years old and live in Hanover, Germany. Currently i study Computer Engineering (Master of Science) at the Leibniz university in Hanover. My whole life i was obsessed with technology, especially computers. At the age of 10 i started to take apart old computers and study all the components to get a better understanding off how the stuff works. Only a year later i bought my first programming book and started to learn C++ in my free time. Since then programming never left my life again. In school my favorite and best subject was IT. When i came home after school, the first thing I did was to start my computer trying to learn something new about coding or hacking (white hat of course ;) ). Thats why after graduation I knew exactly what i want to study. Unfortunately at the university there wasnt a class about IOS app development, which was always a dream of mine to learn some day. So i decided to buy a macbook and started learning to code apps on my own. 
Two years ago i also developed a big interest in DJing and music production. So i started to watch a lot of tutorials and learned everything about the process of making a song, mixing and mastering and publishing it.

I decided to setup this website to show some of my projects and hopefully make a good impression for future applications.

# My Projects

## FPV Drone Shop
My most recent project is a eCommerce FPV Drone Shop. The project is build with wordpress and woocommerce. Users can shop drone parts (Motors, Propellers, ...) to build their own FPV Drone.

Link to the shop: <a href="https://mdrones.de"></a>

## IOS Card Drinking Game App  (Busfahrer)
This is a small drinking game i made called Busfahrer (engl. Busdriver). First the number of players and the names have to be entered. Then every player has to predict the color of the card (black or red). If a player chooses wrong he or she has to drink. Next every player has to predict if the next card is above or below the previous card. If he is wrong again he or she has to take another sip. After four round of guessing every player ends up with 4 hand cards. Next 10 other cards will be revealed. If a player has the same card on the hand cards, another player can be choosen to take a sip of the drink. The player who gave out the most sips is called the "Busfahrer". This player goes ahead to the last final round. There, the player is only allowed to reveal numbered cards. If the guess is wrong, the player has to start over from the beginning and has to drink the amount of sips as the row he failed.

## IOS Workout Timer App
This application is made for your own personal workouts. First, you can add a new workout by pressing the "+" button or delete an existing workout. Once a workout is created it will get stored on the phones memory and reloaded on app launch. On the next screen you can add multiple exercises to your new workout. Every exercise gets a name and a number of seconds. If all exercises were added the workout can be started. Now the timer starts and the exercises appear together with a countdown.

## Crypto Trading Bot (Python)

My newest and current project is a crypto trading bot and backtester. The bot is programmed in python and uses the FTX API to get historic market data. This price data is processed and depending on previous added indicators a decisions is made. If the strategy condition is fulfilled the bot will automatically open a trade through the FTX API.
The images below shows my backtester which is integrated into the trading bot. This backtester can be used to simulate a trading strategy. Therefore before simulation a couple of parameters need to be set. The process bar shows that the simulation is running how far the result is calculated. After finishing calculation the graph button can be used to plot the processed data in the default browser (Plotly library). There the price and several indicators that are part of the selected strategy are shown. Furthermore, all trades are highlighted by markers and a box that shows our start, end, take profit and stop loss values of the trade. The live trading bot doesn't have a GUI yet, and simply runs in the terminal on a raspberry pi 4. This project is just in the beginning phase and much more functionalities will be added soon.

## Pokemon World with Unity

My whole life i loved games and i always wanted to build my own game. Some years ago i had the idea to build my own Pokemon game. So i downloaded some sprites from the internet and build my own map and moving animations for a character. In the end the i had a small pokemon world to run through but without any interactions.

## VR Labyrinth with Unity

In the 5th semester at my university we had to build a VR Game in Unity with a team of 7 people. The goal was to build a dark labyrinth that changes while walking. My part was to design a couple of mini games that the player had to play to get more time and his torch that he needed for light wouldn't burn out. So i designed a VR bowling game and button mashing game. The game was a huge success and is still used for demonstration what students could learn at the university. Sadly there aren't any photots or videos available at the moment.

## Beerpong Cups (Dropshipping)

Last year i started with a partner a project to sell reuseable aluminium beerpong cups online to help the environment by reducing the amount of plastic used on partys. 
We started with a survey to determine what material is best and what prices we could consider to charge. After that we ordererd some sample cups from a huge manufactory and did some testing. Despite, the project idea was very good and fun to work on, we had to stop the project because the cups were to expensive and our survey results doesnt fit with the price requirements. Below are some mockups I created with blender for possible cup designs.

## 3D Design with Blender
It should be obvious now that i really like computer games. One thing is very important if you want to build your own 3D game and this is 3D Models. I started to learn modeling with Blender. I designed weapons, houses, whole maps and many other objects. But i also wanted to do something with my skills for other people. Thats why i designed some cool wallpapers with logos off stuff i like. These images can be downloaded for free and used as a background image. Here are some examples.

## Music Production

Like I said in the info text in the beginning, I also produced some music. But nothing was good enough to get known :(

# Future projects...

## NFT Project

At the moments I'm making plans to start my own NFT project soon. At the moment I'm looking for good artists. Then I'll have to code the generator that takes all drawn masks and put them together using a probability distribution.

## Blockchain Project (DAO)

Also there are some plans to found a DAO that works autonomous on the blockchain. Further details will follow...
