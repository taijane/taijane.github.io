My name is Tjan Meinecke, I'm 22 years old and live in Hanover, Germany. Currently i study Computer Engineering (Master of Science) at the Leibniz university in Hanover. My whole life i was obsessed with technology, especially computers. At the age of 10 i started to take apart old computers and study all the components to get a better understanding off how the stuff works. Only a year later i bought my first programming book and started to learn C++ in my free time. Since then programming never left my life again. In school my favorite and best subject was IT. When i came home after school, the first thing I did was to start my computer trying to learn something new about coding or hacking (white hat of course ;) ). Thats why after graduation I knew exactly what i want to study. Unfortunately at the university there wasnt a class about IOS app development, which was always a dream of mine to learn some day. So i decided to buy a macbook myself and started learning to code apps on my own. 
Two years ago i also developed a big interest in DJing and music production. So i started to watch a lot of tutorials and learned everything about the process of making a song, mixing and mastering and publishing it.

I decided to setup this website to show some of my projects and hopefully make a good impression for future applications.

## My Projects

# Card Drinking Game (Busfahrer)
This is a small drinking game i made called Busfahrer (engl. Busdriver). First the number of players and the names have to be entered. Then every player has to predict the color of the card (black or red). If a player chooses wrong he or she has to drink. Next every player has to predict if the next card is above or below the previous card. If he is wrong again he or she has to take another sip. After four round of guessing every player ends up with 4 hand cards. Next 10 other cards will be revealed. If a player has the same card on the hand cards, another player can be choosen to take a sip of the drink. The player who gave out the most sips is called the "Busfahrer". This player goes ahead to the last final round. There, the player is only allowed to reveal numbered cards. If the guess is wrong, the player has to start over from the beginning and has to drink the amount of sips as the row he failed.
